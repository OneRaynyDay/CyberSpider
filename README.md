# CyberSpider
Implementation of a disk-based hashtable.

##Cyber Attacks##
Cyber attacks are created by files polluting other files or communicating with a website. The website could either create
malicious files or malicious files could communicate with the website.

In our implementation, we created a disk-based hashtable to hold in all the information of telemetry lines(in our case it is randomly generated)
 and from this, and an initial root of lists of malicious files, spread the malicious files infection through many other existing sources.
 
In the end, we get something that looks like this:
